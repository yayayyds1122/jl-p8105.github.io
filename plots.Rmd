# Here are soooome plots

you can make plots in the same way as always


```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100,2,5),
  y = 1+2*x- .5*x^2 + rnorm(100)
)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y))+
  geom_point()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
